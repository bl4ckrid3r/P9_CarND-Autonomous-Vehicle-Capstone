This is the Capstone project for Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. This system integration project implements and integrates the Perception, Planning, and Control modules using the Robot Operating System (ROS) in order to program a real self-driving car.

## System Architecture
---
![][image0]

The project uses the Robot Operating System (ROS) and implements the following ROS packages:

* **tl_detector** 

	Traffic light detector which uses the front-facing camera to detect upcoming traffic lights.
	
* **twist_controller** 

	Responsible for controlling the vehicle by sending commands to the car's Drive-By-Wire (dbw) system.
	
* **waypoint_follower** 

	Code from [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) which issues twist commands to the DWB node.

* **waypoint_loader**

	Loads the static *Waypoints* of the route.

* **waypoint_updater** 
	
	Decides the car's behavior based on the route and traffic lights.

* **styx**

	A package that contains a server for communicating with the simulator, and a bridge to translate and publish simulator messages to ROS topics.

* **styx_msgs** 
	
	A package which includes definitions of the custom ROS message types used in the project.

**The source code for the modules can be found in the [src](./ros/src/) folder.**

## Installation Instructions
---
Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the "uWebSocketIO Starter Guide" found in the classroom (see Extended Kalman Filter Project lesson).

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images

### Other library/driver information
Outside of `requirements.txt`, here is information on other driver/library versions used in the simulator and Carla:

Specific to these libraries, the simulator grader and Carla use the following:

|        | Simulator | Carla  |
| :-----------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Nvidia driver | 384.130 | 384.130 |
| CUDA | 8.0.61 | 8.0.61 |
| cuDNN | 6.0.21 | 6.0.21 |
| TensorRT | N/A | N/A |
| OpenCV | 3.2.0-dev | 2.4.8 |
| OpenMP | N/A | N/A |

We are working on a fix to line up the OpenCV versions between the two.
